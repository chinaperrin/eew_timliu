How to compute waveform azimuth in realt time

1. NDs method
az(i)   = atan(-ev_mean/-nv_mean); (where ev_mean and nv_mean are the mean of the dot product of horizontal and vertical components since the p-pick)

2. backazimuth from the eigentvectors of the covariance matrix (horizontal components only)
[eVal1,eVal2,eVect1,eVect2] = principal_component_2D(E(i-tw_az:i),N(i-tw_az:i));

3. new method: find raidal and transversal comps by rotating sesimogram until high freqs are maximal on (radial) and low freqs are maximal on (transversal)
